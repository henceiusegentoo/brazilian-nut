Build Rust-part using Maturin, build Python-part using Poetry. <br>
If you simply want to run the project, the Python part already has a compiled version of the Rust part for Linux. In general, I'd recommend to use this on Linux only because because Rust on Windows is a pain in the ass.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Go into brazilian_nut_wrapper
3. execute `poetry install`
4. execute `poetry run python __main__.py`
5. ???
6. Success
